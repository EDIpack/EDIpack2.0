EDIpack2.0 is a Lanczos based Exact Diagonalization method 
for the solution of generic Quantum Impurity problems,  exploiting MPI
distributed memory parallelisation.
The 2.0 version extends the former EDIpack_ library enabling the solution of
single-site, multi-orbital models with different conserved
quantum numbers :math:`\vec{Q}` corresponding to separate operational
modes which, in `EDIpack2.0` software, are selected by the input
variable `ed_mode=normal,superc,nonsu2` as follow: 

* :math:`\vec{Q}=[\vec{N}_\uparrow,\vec{N}_\downarrow]` for which
  either the number of total or orbital spin up and down electrons is
  conserved: **NORMAL** 

* :math:`\vec{Q}=S_z`  with conserved total magnetization:  **SUPERConducting**  

* :math:`\vec{Q}=N_{\rm tot}`  where spin degrees freedom is not fully conserved:  **NON-SU(2)**


.. note::
   The `superc` mode deals with local *s*-wave pairing although in 
   diagonal and off-diagonal orbital channels. The actual
   implementation does not support long-range magnetic ordering.
   
.. note::
   The `nonsu2` operational mode deals with any situation in which
   spin symmetry group is not fully conserved, for instance in
   presence of local Spin-Orbit Coupling :math:`\vec{L} \cdot \vec{S}`,
   in-plane magnetization :math:`\langle S_x\rangle\gt0`  or in-plane
   triplet excitonic condensation, see `PhysRevB.107.115117`_. 

.. _PhysRevB.107.115117: https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.107.115117


All operational modes include **electron-phonon** coupling (local or Holstein
phonons). EDIpack2.0  is designed to obtain the lowest part of the
spectrum of the problem, thus it naturally works at **zero temperature**
but can also be used to explore **low temperature** properties.  
 
The EDIpack2.0 diagonalization algorithm is based on a massively
parallel execution of matrix-vector products, required in the context
of Lanczos-Arnoldi linear procedures.  See `j.cpc.2021.108261`_  for a detailed
descriptions of these algorithms.
However, substantial modifications have been introduced in the 2.0
version to address the *Superconducting* and *non-SU(2)* channels.  
An updated manuscript will be released soon.
