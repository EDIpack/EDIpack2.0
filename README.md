A suitable extension of [EDIpack](https://github.com/edipack/EDIpack): a  Lanczos based method 
for the solution of generic Quantum Impurity problems,  exploiting distributed memory MPI parallelisation.
This updated version, aims to solve single-site, multi-orbital models, in either  *normal*, *superconducting* (s-wave) or *Spin-non-conserving* (e.g. with Spin-Orbit Coupling or in-plane magnetization) phases, including electron-phonons coupling. The code works at zero and low temperatures.   
 
See [j.cpc.2021.108261](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108261) for further information about the underlying algorithms. Yet, suitable modifications have been developed to address the Superconducting and non-SU(2) channels.  

### Install & Use

*EDIpack* builds and get installed using CMake. Loading into the operative systemisis provided by different methods, including module environment.    
Further informations and a guided proceudre are available in the documentation.


### Documentation
All the informations about the structure of the library and its use, together with the Python API *EDIpy2*, are documented at [edipack.github.io/EDIpack/](https://edipack.github.io/EDIpack/)  

NOTE: The documentation is currently under construction.
