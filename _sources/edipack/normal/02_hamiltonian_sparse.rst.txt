Stored Hamiltonian :math:`H\times\vec{v}`  
==============================================

The module :f:mod:`ED_HAMILTONIAN_NORMAL_STORED_HXV` implements the
construction of the sector Hamiltonian as sparse matrices and the related
matrix-vector products algorithms, either in serial or parallel
execution.
Different implementations are available according to the value of 
:f:var:`ed_total_ud`, distinguishing between conservation of total
or orbital resolved spin occupations.
