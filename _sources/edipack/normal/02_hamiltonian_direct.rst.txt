Hamiltonian Direct :math:`H\times\vec{v}`
==============================================

In the module :f:mod:`ED_HAMILTONIAN_NORMAL_DIRECT_HXV` we implement
the direct, i.e. on-the-fly, sector Hamiltonian-input vector product
:math:`\vec{w} = H\times \vec{v}`.
Different implementations are available according to the value of 
:f:var:`ed_total_ud`, distinguishing between conservation of total
or orbital resolved spin occupations and the serial or parallel case.
