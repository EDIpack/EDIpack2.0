Hamiltonian Direct :math:`H\times\vec{v}`
==============================================


The module :f:mod:`ED_HAMILTONIAN_NONSU2_DIRECT_HXV` constructs and
execute the direct, i.e. on-the-fly, product between the sector
Hamiltonian and an input vector :math:`\vec{w} = H\times \vec{v}` as
required by Arpack/Lanczos linear operations.

Different functions are implemented for the serial and the parallel case.
